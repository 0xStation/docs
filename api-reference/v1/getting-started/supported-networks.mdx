title: "Supported Networks"

Our smart contracts are written in Solidity, limiting them to the EVM.

GroupOS is live on the following networks:
| Network | Chain ID |
| -- | -- |
| Ethereum | 1 |
| Ethereum Goerli | 5 |
| Ethereum Sepolia | 11155111 |
| Polygon | 137 |
| Optimism | 10 |
| Arbitrum | 42161 |
| Linea Mainnet | 59144 |

To evaluate your network needs, [schedule a short call](https://calendly.com/symmtry/chat) with our team.

Tokens are uniquely identified by the combination of their smart contract address and the network it resides,
often labeled with `contractAddress` and `chainId` repspectively. If you are uncertain about the `chainId` of
your network, refer to [this list](https://chainlist.org/).
