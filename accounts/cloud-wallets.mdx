title: "Cloud Wallets"
---

Our key-based cloud wallets offers versatile use cases catering to various needs. Below are some of the key applications:

- **Walletless Onboarding**: Seamless onboarding by integrating with Single Sign-On (SSO) solutions or other authentication systems. This simplifies the process for users, enabling easy access with existing credentials.
- **Passkey Onboarding**: Users utilize their device to produce a signature with their passkey, resulting in a signed request forwarded to your app’s backend for authentication.
- **Automations**: Sign transactions and automate executions on behalf of your users. Examples include automated staking, swapping, and other recurring transactions.

## Pre-requisite
- You’ve set up your API key. Follow [this tutorial](/introduction/quickstart) to get started.

## Create Cloud Wallets

Using the [/api/v1/key/post/create](/api-reference/v1/key/post/create) route, you can embed wallet creation at any point in your application e.g. at sign up.

```typescript
const key = "YOUR_API_KEY";

const body = {
  customRef: "user@email.com"
};

try {
  const response = await fetch("https://groupos.xyz/api/v1/key/create", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
	  "Content-Type": "application/json",
	  Authorization: `Bearer ${key} `
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(body)
  });
} catch (e) {
  // catch errors
}
```
