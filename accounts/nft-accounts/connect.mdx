## Run your test

1. Go to your application. Navigate to WalletConnect.

2. Copy the WalletConnect string. Go to [Connect Portal](https://groupos.xyz/wc) and paste the string.

3. Select an NFT Account to connect. Check if the connected wallet in the application matches that of the Account.
  <Warning>Do not close the Connect Portal tab as transaction confirmation will happen in this tab.</Warning>

4. Perform transactions.
