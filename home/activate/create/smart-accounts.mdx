Smart Accounts is the simplest way to create programmatic accounts for members of your network. It allows you to add web3 capabilities to your applications instantly with or without user actions while abstracting away onchain complexities like gas operations. 

**Web3 capabilities enabled by smart accounts**

- Passwordless onboarding
- Programmatically distribute onchain rewards based on a set condition
- Customize gas operations based on onchain reputation
- Interoperable user accounts

**Use cases**

- User accounts for donation platforms
- User accounts for DAO tools
- User accounts for onchain games

Developers can leverage our SDK for an out-of-the-box account creation flow. Smart Accounts are currently in private beta. [Get on the list](https://6vdcjqzyfj3.typeform.com/to/x3xer1Rs).
