### Checklist

- If your application doesn't support WalletConnect, follow [this tutorial](https://docs.walletconnect.com/web3modal/about) to integrate.

For the sections below, please refer to ![WalletConnect documentation](https://docs.walletconnect.com/api/sign/dapp-usage)

**Contract Signatures**

- [EIP-1271](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1271) must be supported
    <Info>Recommended: viem’s [verifyMessage](https://viem.sh/docs/actions/public/verifyMessage.html) public client function is recommended</Info>

**Networks*

-  Connection is established with Mainnet + selected NFT account chain

**Methods**

- `eth_sendTransaction` which will sign the requested tx, send out and
return the tx hash
- Simple data signing support using `personal_sign`
- Typed data signing support using `eth_signTypedData_v4`

**Events**

- Network suggestion (NFT’s network) sent to dApps using `chainChanged` event
- Account switching adjusts WalletConnect session and informs the dApp via `accountsChanged` event
- WalletConnect session termination from a dApp automatically resets Connect as NFT state by reacting to `session_delete` event

### Current limitations

- Accounts need to be deployed on the same chain as the connected chain on the application to transact. Currently, we intentionally kill the session if the network of the NFT Account and the selected network on the application is mismatched.
