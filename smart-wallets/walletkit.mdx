`@groupos/walletkit` is a package for adding and utilizing smart accounts in decentralized applications (dApps).
It comes with customization options that meet your needs to offer a seamless user experience â€” social onboarding, gas sponsorship, and batch transactions.

Unlike existing smart account packages, **WalletKit lets developers retain access to the same core [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/react) hooks for signing and transacting**.
We accomplish this by connecting all smart accounts as native account objects instead of creating a new smart account object that needs explicit calling.

## Quickstart

### Pre-requisite

- In the **Dashboard**, Go to Settings > General, and copy your `groupId`.
- Next go to **Allowed Domains** and add the domain of your app to the allowlist.

### Install the package

From the root of the project that is consuming the package type the following to install the package.

```typescript
npm install @groupos/walletkit wagmi@2.x
```

### Import the component

Next, import the component and use it wherever you see fit. The component takes one prop, which is the `groupId` you should have copied from step 1.

```ts
import { useAccount } from "wagmi";
import { SmartAuthBox } from "@groupos/walletkit";

function Page() {
  const { address } = useAccount();

  return !address ? (
    <SmartAuthBox groupId="STATION_GROUP_ID" />
  ) : (
    {
      /** ... */
    }
  );
}
```

All connected accounts, even EOAs, will get wrapped with a smart account, empowering them to support features
like batch transactions and gas sponsorship. You can access this account with wagmi-native `useAccount` and interact with it via the same core wagmi react hooks.
