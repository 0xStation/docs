Badges are digital symbols that can be used to represent achievements, qualifications, or status. Reward your members with badges (ERC-1155) to incentivize participation in initiatives that drive results.

**Why onchain badges?**

- Unlocks onchain incentive mechanisms e.g. stake badges to earn more points (to improve member retention)
- Permissionless usage of data e.g. showcasing member badges in different clients
- Compatibility with other web3 applications e.g. token-gate access to Telegram groups with [Guild](https://guild.xyz/explorer)
- Sybil resistance e.g. only members with at least 3 badges can claim future rewards or vote on proposals

**Examples of use cases**

- Game tournament badges
- Hackathon participation badges
- Event tickets and attendance
- Permit receipts
- Ownership claims
- Onchain roles
