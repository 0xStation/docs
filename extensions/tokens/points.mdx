**Why onchain Points?**

- Unlocks onchain incentive mechanisms e.g. stake membership to earn more points (to improve member retention)
- Permissionless usage of data e.g. showcasing member points in different front-clients
- Compatibility with DeFi functionalities
- Interoperable with other web3 applications


GroupOS's Points come with the following functionalities:

  <Card title="Points Querying and Retrieval" icon="square-1" color="#ad72ff">
    Querying and retrieval data is slow and painful. GroupOS listens to the onchain updates and enable developers to query points with simple API calls.

  <Card title="Automation via API" icon="square-2" color="#ad72ff">
    Automatically mint and distribute based on offchain events with our Points API.  
  </Card>
  <Card title="Batched Execution" icon="square-4" color="#ad72ff">
    Base ERC-20 does not allow for batch execution of transactions, making automation of transactions very expensive. We enable developers to execute a batch of multiple calls for 4337-compliant member Accounts (like ours). Transactions are submitted through our ERC-4337 bundler system which abstracts away the need for your accounts or your users to provide gas.
