   <Accordion title="Network">
    The selected network houses your membership collection on-chain. 
    **Mainnet**

    - Ethereum
    - Your audience or existing token ecosystem is on Ethereum.
    - Polygon
    - Your audience is chain-agnostic and cost-sensitive. Transactions on Polygon are about 500x less expensive than those on Ethereum.
    <br />
    **Testnet**

    **Goerli:** The test network supported by GroupOS that enables you to do dry runs of your membership collection without needing to spend real ETH on a main network. Here’s the list of places you can get free test ETH:
    - [QuickNode faucet](https://faucet.quicknode.com/ethereum/goerli)
