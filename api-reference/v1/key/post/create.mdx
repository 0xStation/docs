### Key-based wallets
Our key-based cloud wallets offers versatile use cases catering to various needs. Below are some of the key applications:

- **Walletless Onboarding**: Seamless onboarding by integrating with Single Sign-On (SSO) solutions or other authentication systems. This simplifies the process for users, enabling easy access with existing credentials.
- **Passkey Onboarding**: Users utilize their device to produce a signature with their passkey, resulting in a signed request forwarded to your app's backend for authentication.
-Â **Automations**: Sign transactions and automate executions on behalf of your users. Examples include automated staking, swapping, and other recurring transactions.


### Key custody

Currently, keys are custodied in the cloud with secure enclave technology through our partner [Turnkey](https://www.turnkey.com/).
This allows you and your users to easily onboard to a dApp without needing to touch private keys. For more information about
key security and operations, please contact us at our Help Desk.
