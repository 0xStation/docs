title: "Automate Execution"
---

Automate onchain tasks based on onchain or offchain events.

**Examples**

- If gas price is below 0.001 ETH, execute all the pending transactions for all Accounts bound to the NFTs from the same collection.
- If the ETH price is below \$1500, buy \$10,000 worth of ETH and distribute evenly to all Accounts as gas allowances.

This is in private beta. [Schedule a call](https://calendly.com/fakepixels/station-partnership) to get started.
