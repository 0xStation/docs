GroupOS's Membership is the most flexible way to monetize your NFTs. 

Built on ERC-721, Membership ensures onchain uniqueness of each NFT for your members.

The Membership component comes with the following features:

    Design and customize to the Mint Portal to match with your brand and collect members' information.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Price Configuration" icon="square-2" color="#ad72ff">
    Members can purchase membership with web3-native payment methods - pay with network tokens (e.g. ETH, MATIC) or USD-denominated stablecoins.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Gasless Minting" icon="square-3" color="#ad72ff">
    We offer you an option to subsidize gas for your members so they members don't have to worry about acquiring and bridging tokens to pay for gas fees when minting the membership, decreasing the membership onboarding drop-off rate.  
  </Card>
  <Card title="Dynamic Directory" icon="square-4" color="#ad72ff">
    Each Membership collection comes with a dynamic directory (also known as 'Web3-native CRM') where admins can view members' onchain and offchain data in one view.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Automation via API" icon="square-5" color="#ad72ff">
    Automatically mint, update NFT metadata, and batch execute transactions based on offchain events with our Account API.  
  </Card>
  <Card title="Membership Querying and Retrieval" icon="square-6" color="#ad72ff">
    Querying and retrieval data is slow and painful. GroupOS listens to the onchain updates and enable developers to query Membership with simple API calls.
