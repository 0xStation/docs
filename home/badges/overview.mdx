Badges (ERC-1155) are digital symbols that represent achievements, qualifications, or status.

**Why onchain Badges?**

- Unlocks onchain incentive mechanisms e.g. stake badges to earn more points (to improve member retention)
- Permissionless usage of data e.g. showcasing member badges in different clients
- Compatibility with other web3 applications e.g. token-gate access to Telegram groups with [Guild](https://guild.xyz/explorer)
- Sybil resistance e.g. only members with at least 3 badges can claim future rewards or vote on proposals

GroupOS's Badges come with the following functionalities:

  <Card title="Badges Querying and Retrieval" icon="square-1" color="#ad72ff">
    Querying and retrieval data is slow and painful. GroupOS listens to the onchain updates and enable developers to query badges with simple API calls.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Dynamic Metadata Updates" icon="square-2" color="#ad72ff">
    Updating member NFT image (e.g. updating a player's rank) and other metadata based on members' actions in a network can be done with simple API calls.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Brandable Mint Portal" icon="square-3" color="#ad72ff">
    Design and customize the Mint Portal to match with your brand.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Batched Execution" icon="square-4" color="#ad72ff">
    Base ERC-1155 does not allow for batch execution of transactions, making automation of transactions very expensive. We enable developers to execute a batch of multiple calls for 4337-compliant member Accounts (like ours). Transactions are submitted through our ERC-4337 bundler system which abstracts away the need for your accounts or your users to provide gas.
