### Why Portal?

By enabling users to bring their Smart/NFT Accounts across applications, we help minimize the fragmentation that results from distributing one account/wallet per application. When used with GroupOS toolkit, applications can offer this flexibility to their users while still able to manage user permissions and automate transactions for a seamless user experience.
