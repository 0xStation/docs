<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="NFT Accounts" icon="square-1" color="#ad72ff">
    Deploy Collections of NFT Accounts and distribute them to your members through your applications with our API or Branded Mint Portal. Each account is ERC-6551 and ERC-4337 compliant smart contract wallet (also known as 'NFT-as-a-wallet' or 'Tokenbound Accounts'), which offers full programmability and extensibility. 
  </Card>
  <Card title="Gasless Member Experience" icon="square-2" color="#ad72ff">
    Your members don't have to worry about acquiring and bridging tokens to pay for transaction fees. GroupOS allows you to launch your applications and communities where you and your members can benefit from the interoperable nature of onchain data without experiencing the frustrations from having to sign and pay fees for every action they take.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Brandable Mint Portal" icon="square-3" color="#ad72ff">
    Design and customize to the Mint Portal to match with your brand and collect members' information. Mint Portal comes with the ability to configure fees, eligibility, time window, and offchain information you look to collect from your members.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Automation via API" icon="square-4" color="#ad72ff">
    Automatically mint, update NFT metadata, and batch execute transactions based on offchain events with our Account API.  
  </Card>
  <Card title="Connect as NFT" icon="square-5" color="#ad72ff">
    Members with NFT Accounts can connect their them to any third-party site using GroupOS Wallet Connect integration. We also work with selected partners to implement embeddable "Log in with NFT" experience on their sites.
