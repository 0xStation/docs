Automate onchain tasks based on onchain or offchain events.

**Examples**
- If gas price is below 0.001 ETH, execute all the pending transactions for all Accounts in the Account Group.
- If the ETH price is below $1500, buy $10,000 worth of ETH and distribute evenly to all Accounts as gas allowances.

Custom Execution is in private beta. [Schedule a call](https://calendly.com/fakepixels/station-partnership) to get started.
