<Info>
  The admin permission inherits all other permissions. This is a high severity
  power and should only be granted to trusted parties. Its intended use is for
  manageement convenience for small-scale collaborations.

<Info>
  Permits permissions enable an address to guide an operation, but only via
  signatures to be consumed by another contract that has the complete
  permission. For example, `MINT_PERMIT` enables an address to approve new
  members to mint, but the mint logic is carried out by a smart contract with
  `MINT` permission to enforce payment to join.
