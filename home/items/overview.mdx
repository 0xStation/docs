Onchain in-game assets and items like potions, armors, weapons, and collectibles help developers streamline inventory management and unlock new revenue opportunities from cross-universe partnership.

**Why onchain badges?**

- Unlocks onchain incentive mechanisms e.g. stake points to earn more items (to improve member retention)
- Permissionless usage of data e.g. showcasing member items in different clients
- Interoperable with other web3 applications e.g. the same armor used across different game universes or brand partnership

  <Card title="Batched Execution" icon="square-4" color="#ad72ff">
    Base ERC-1155 does not allow for batch execution of transactions, making automation of transactions very expensive. We enable developers to execute a batch of multiple calls for 4337-compliant member Accounts (like ours). Transactions are submitted through our ERC-4337 bundler system which abstracts away the need for your accounts or your users to provide gas.
