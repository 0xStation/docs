After getting started with WalletKit in your project, you can add session keys to your users' smart accounts.
Session keys enable you to ask once for scoped permission to sign on behalf of the wallet for the remainder
of the user's session.

If a session key is available for a user, it is automatically used in existing signature and transaction hooks,
leaving your developer experience untouched.

## Quickstart

Prompt users to approve a session key with the `useSessionKeys` hook.

```ts
import { useSessionKeys } from "@groupos/walletkit";

function Page() {
  const { requestSessionKey } = useSessionKeys();

  return (
    <div>
        <div>Enable 1-click trading</div>
        <button
            onClick={() => requestSessionKey({ scope: { contract: "0x..." } })}
        >
            Add Device
        </button>
    </div>
}
```
