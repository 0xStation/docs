<Info>This feature is available to ERC-721 collections created on GroupOS.</Info>

Programmatically update the traits of the NFT Wallets based on user's activities and token ownership. This metadata will be automatically reflected on GroupOS, your application, and third-party platforms that support ERC-721 standards e.g. OpenSea and Zora. 

**Examples**
- Player's EXP (ERC-20 token balance)
- User's Points (ERC-20 token balance)
- User's active status (ERC-1155 badge)
