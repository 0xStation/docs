### Batch Permiting

If a particular user has earned a large amount of permits, it may be easier to batch them together. This way, the user only needs to execute a single transaction to claim all of their available permits. This endpoint batches all of the permits for a user from a particular token collection together and returns a single transaction that can be used to claim all of the tokens at once.

  The id of the chain supporting the token.
